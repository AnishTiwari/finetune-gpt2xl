{"text": "In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,\nBut thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,\nIn act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,\nIn vowing new hate after new love bearing:\nBut why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,  \nWhen I break twenty? I am perjured most,\nFor all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:\nAnd all my honest faith in thee is lost.\nFor I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:\nOaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,\nAnd to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,\nOr made them swear against the thing they see.\nFor I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,\nTo swear against the truth so foul a be.\n\nCupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,\nA maid of Dian's this advantage found,\nAnd his love-kindling fire did quickly steep\nIn a cold valley-fountain of that ground:\nWhich borrowed from this holy fire of Love,\nA dateless lively heat still to endure,\nAnd grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,\nAgainst strange maladies a sovereign cure:\nBut at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,  \nThe boy for trial needs would touch my breast,\nI sick withal the help of bath desired,\nAnd thither hied a sad distempered guest.\nBut found no cure, the bath for my help lies,\nWhere Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.\n\nThe little Love-god lying once asleep,\nLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,\nWhilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,\nCame tripping by, but in her maiden hand,\nThe fairest votary took up that fire,\nWhich many legions of true hearts had warmed,\nAnd so the general of hot desire,\nWas sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.\nThis brand she quenched in a cool well by,\nWhich from Love's fire took heat perpetual,\nGrowing a bath and healthful remedy,\nFor men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,\nCame there for cure and this by that I prove,  \nLove's fire heats water, water cools not love."}
